1) heisenberg_exact.f90 is written by Giannozz(http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~giannozz/), it is used to check spin 1/2 chain with periodic boundary condition.

2) ed_spin.py: It is spin 1/2 chain with open boundary condition, including N, J, h-field and disorder on each site.

For spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain,

| N  | E/N (OBC)| E/N (PBC) |
