1) heisenbergy_exact.f90 is written by Giannozz(http://www.fisica.uniud.it/~giannozz/), it is used to check spin 1/2 chain with periodic boundary condition.

2) ed_spin.py: It is spin 1/2 chain with open boundary condition, including N, J, h-field and disordr on each site.

For spin 1/2 chain with open boundary condition,

| N  | E/N |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 2  | -0.75  |
| 3  | -1/3  |
| 4 | -0.40400635 |
| 5 | -0.38557725 |
